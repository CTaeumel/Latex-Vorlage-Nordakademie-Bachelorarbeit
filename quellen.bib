In this paper, model-based sonification is presented as a concept to design auditory displays. Two designs are described: (1) particle trajectories in a “data potential” is a sonification model to reveal information about the clustering of vectorial data and (2) “data-sonograms” is a sonification for data from a classification problem to reveal information about the mixing of distinct classes.},

  abstract = {The field of sonification is a subset of auditory display. It brings together interests from data mining, exploratory data analysis, humancomputer interface and musical interfaces. Sonification is the mapping of data to sound; it is a rich and relatively unexplored technique for data mining. The idea behind sonification is that nonverbal sounds can be used to represent numerical data and provide support for information processing activities of many different kinds. In this paper we present three quantification rules for using sonification in data mining. We also present an RPAI (Rain Prediction Auditory Icon) Algorithm to predict rain using auditory icon. This integrates two new areas of research i.e. sonification and climate data mining. Weather data mining (forecasting) gained a lot of interest in last couple of years due to its large applications on Water, Agriculture, Energy, Health and Retail Market. The use of climate data mining is new and is in its infancy stages of being used for a variety of businesses. This creates the opportunity to explore enhancements to decision strategies through a suite of research analysis and tool development. We perform experiments using RPAI algorithm on rain data from a metrological site and discuss the results.},

Approaches for designing sonifications are surveyed, and issues raised by the existing approaches and applications are outlined. Relations are drawn to other areas of knowledge where similar issues have also arisen, such as human-computer interaction, scientific visualisation, and computer music.

  title = {{{MUSE}}: {{A Musical Data Sonification Toolkit}}},
  abstract = {Data sonification is the representation of data using sound. Last year we presented a flexible, interactive and portable data sonification toolkit called LISTEN, that allows mapping of data to several sound parameters such as pitch, volume, timbre and duration [20]. One of the potential drawbacks of LISTEN is that since the sounds generated are non-musical, they can be fatiguing when exploring large data sets over extended periods of time. A primary goal in the design of MUSE -- a MUsical Sonification Environment -- is to map scientific data to musical sounds. The challenge is to ensure that the data meanings are preserved and brought out by these mappings. MUSE provides flexible data mappings to musical sounds using parameters such as pitch (melody), rhythm, tempo, volume, timbre and harmony. MUSE is written in C++ for the SGI platform and works with the freely available sound specification software CSound developed at MIT. We have applied MUSE to map uncertainty in some scientific data sets to musical sounds.},
